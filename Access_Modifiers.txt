 we have a access modifiers are 1) public 2) private 3) protected 4) default 

1) Public we want to access the outside the package we always make public it easy to access.
 -> it can access by any where ..

2) Private which we can use in a same class we do not access it in out side the class ..

3) default -> which we can access it in same package but not out side the package..

4) Protected -> which we can use in the sameclass ,samepackage subclass , not work in otherPackages ..

We have question which one is to use ?..
  -> we try to make your class as public 
  -> try to keep instence variable as private..
  -> methods should be in public ..
  -> do not use default so much..
